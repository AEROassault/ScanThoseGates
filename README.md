Adds an ability to that allows users to scan all gates in systems with at least one non-hidden (not pirate/pather base) market, and adds the scanned gates to the intel screen. Options are available in the settings.json for the scan to add gates in marketless systems to the intel screen or to scan them.

Can be safely removed from an active game by setting "PrepareForRemoval" to true in the settings.json file (located at /ScanThoseGates/data/config/settings.json). After setting the option to true, load the savegame, then save and exit. The mod can now be safely removed.

A very big thank you to Wispborne, Timid, SafariJohn and ruddygreat for their help getting this working and fixing bugs.
