Adds an ability to that allows users to scan all gates in systems with at least one non-hidden (not pirate/pather base) market, and adds the scanned gates to the intel screen. Options are available in the settings.json for the scan to add gates in marketless systems to the intel screen or to scan them.

Not safe to remove from an active game.

A very big thank you to Wispborne, Timid, SafariJohn and ruddygreat for their help getting this working and fixing bugs.
