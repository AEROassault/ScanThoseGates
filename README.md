Scans all gates that are located in systems with at least one non-hidden market at save start when Nexerelin Skip Story or the Skip Story mod is enabled. Scanned gates are added to the intel screen. Options are available in the settings.json for adding inactive gates to intel or scanning inactive gates during game startup.

Has no effect if you complete the Galatia quests yourself. This mod is safe to remove from an active game.

A very big thank you to Wispborne, Timid, SafariJohn and ruddygreat for their help getting this working and fixing bugs.
